    As a recent graduate from Saint Louis University, I am a highly motivated and hard-working young professional looking to ignite my new career. After having studied at the College for Public Health and Social Justice and earning a degree in Health Management, I have gained a wide range of knowledge in many fields ranging from business and information technology, to health sciences and data analytics.
  </p>
  <p>
    With an apt to learn quickly and effectively, I strive to accomplish personal and professional goals with hard work and disciplined precision. In search of a position that will allow me to utilize my strengths and contribute to the success of a determined team, I look forward to finding a position where I can put my knowledge and resources to use to lead me towards a bright future. My goal is to address the many benefits data analysis can provide within the realm of healthcare.
